            <h2 class="r1"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br>
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br>
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>
                weeks was the best and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've <br>
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup

            <p class="t3">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br>
                never written a line of code. I needed <br>
                some structure from professionals <br>
                who can help me learn programming <br>
                step by step. I was encouraged to <br>
                enroll by a former student of theirs <br>
                who can only say wonderful things <br>
                about the program. The entire <br>
                curriculum and staff did not <br>
                disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>
                and I never had to wait long for <br>
                assistance. The agile team project, in <br>
                particular, was outstanding. It took <br>
                my learning to the next level in a way <br>
                that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>
                fact, I've often referred to it during <br>
                interviews as an example of my <br>
                developent experience. It certainly <br>
                helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
                developer after receiving multiple <br>
                offers. 100% recommend!"

            <p class="t5">*The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br>
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>
                myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br>
